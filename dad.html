                <h1>Dad's Finances</h1>
                <p>National Insurance Number: KB028524A</p>
                <p>Dad has a Barclays current account, from which all his bills are paid, and a number of savings accounts. His bills really only ammount to:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>His rent to Victoria grand, paid on the first of the month by direct debit.</li>
                  <li>His newspaper bill, paid every four weeks. I get an email from them and do a bank transfer from his current account.</li>
                  <li>Cash that I take out of our account and give to him. I then do a bank transfer for his account into ours. His debit card expired in 2020 and I didn't renew it.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The strategy is that fixed-term savings account mature at various times and, when they do, they are either reinvested in a fixed term account or transferred (via his current account) into an easy access account. Money is then moved each month from that easy access account into his current account so as to pay his rent. The maturity dates for the fixed-term accounts are arranged so as to provide the necessary cash flow.</p>
                <p>Until April 2021 Dad had two NS&amp;I bonds, but the interest rate on their new bonds dropped to 0.01%. So I moved the money to a collection of other accounts, so as to keep the total in each below the Â£85K fscs guarantee.</p>
                <p>As of October 2021, his accounts are:</p>
                <table>
                  <tr>
                    <td>Current Account</td>
                    <td>Barclays - this is a joint account with me and I have online access.</td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td>Santander</td>
                    <td>A savings account to which Dad and I have online access. There is only a few pounds left in it.</td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td>RCI Bank</td>
                    <td>An easy access account with his Barclays account as the 'nominated' account. Money is manually transferred from this account into his current account each month, in time for his rent to be paid, which is done by direct debit on the 1st of the month. This account is 'topped up' as required when fixed-term accounts mature.</td>
