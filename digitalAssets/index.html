                <h1>Digital Assets</h1>
                <p>In addition to various documents, we have quite a lot of information stored in digital form. It seems that the present-day term for these pieces of information is 'digital assets', so this page tries to list those assets and points you to their source.</p>
                <p>Much of this digital information is of no value and most of it needs sorting out (deleting or organising). Perhaps that will happen over the coming years. However, we will look at our digital assets in the form of email, web sites, photos and videos and then look at the service providers and the various devices that we own.</p>
                <p>Our intent is that our executors will have legal access to all these assets and there is a general clause on the subject in our wills. However, each service provider seems to have their own process for granting access.</p>
                <h2>Email</h2>
                <p>David has three email accounts and Angela has one.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>dr.david.james@gmail.com - This is my main personal email and is used as the user id for a lot of online access sites.</li>
                  <li>david.james.48@icloud.com - This address is used as the user id for GitHub (see below).</li>
                  <li>david.james@ietvolunteer.org - This is my IET Office 365 email account and so is used for all IET-related correspondence.</li>
                  <li>angelajames11@gmail.com - Angela's personal email account. It started out as angelajames11@googlemail.com, which may be used for some user ids.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Perhaps the most important thing is to set up a suitable 'out of office' auto-reply. This can be done by creating a rule in Apple Mail.</p>
                <h2>Web Sites</h2>
                <p>GitHub is the server for all our websites, using the 'Pages' facility. This means that all sites are 'public'. Details of login, etc. can be found in Notes. However, both the iMac and the MackBook Air have GitHub Desktop installed, which is my usual means of accessing the files. I use Atom as an editor.</p>
                <p>Copies of the folders and files are on the IMac and MacBook Air (as well as the iPad), so that they can be updated via all devices. There are a number of 'repositories', most of which can be accessed via our home page (within the WebPages repository) or pages leading from that. There are, however, a couple that can only be accessed directly.</p>
                <h2>Photographs</h2>
                <p>This is probably the most difficult area, since photos are scattered over various locations, some of which are not backed up. These locations are:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Apple Photos on the iMac. Generally these are grouped into Albums and some photos have descriptions attached. These are not backed up.</li>
                  <li>The Users/david/Documents/PhotoCollections contains a variety of photos, which are not backed up.</li>
                  <li>The Pictures folder on the iMac is where older collections of photos reside, mainly in folders, but with a lot of odds and ends. These are not backed up.</li>
                  <li>Within some folders on Google Drive and iCloud Drive, for example in the Cars folder. Dropbox only contains a few photos. In other words, photos are scattered around all over the place. At least these three 'cloud' services should be backed up.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Videos</h2>
                <p>Apart from some short video clips, all major videos are stored within iMovie on the iMac, which means that they are not backed up. A number of these are recordings of IET talks, which could be deleted. Exports from iMovie result in enormous files. These can be reduced by running them through Handbrake, but still take more storage space than I have on my 'free' cloud sites.</p>
                <h2>Service Providers</h2>
                <p>When it comes to access by executors to files stored on mail servers or cloud services, each service provider takes a different approach. However, each cloud storage service stores copies of the files on the local device, so all files are readily available. These are the service providers that we use:</p>
                <h3>Google<img class="i300" src="images/GoogleIAM.png"></h3>
                <p>We both have email accounts with Google as described above. We also use Google Drive, currently using just over half of our free storage allocation.</p>
                <p>Google have an <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/3036546">Inactive Account Manager</a> that allows the account owner to define to what data one or more trusted contacts are given access. You also have to specify what is meant by 'inactive'. This has not yet been set up.</p>
                <h3>iCloud</h3>
                <p>I have an iCloud email account, as noted above, and iCloud Drive. At the time of writing I only have 13% of the free space available.</p>
                <p>Apple's facility for gaining access to someone's data is a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT212360">'Legacy Contact'.</a> One or more contacts are provided with a 'key', which, together with the death certificate, can be used to access data. This has not yet been set up.</p>
                <h3>GitHub<img class="i300" src="images/GitHub.png"></h3>
                <p>All our web sites are hosted on GitHub. It is possible to invite a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/maintaining-ownership-continuity-of-your-user-accounts-repositories">'successor'</a> who, by presenting a death certificate, is given access to public repositories. Once again, this has not been set up.</p>
                <h3>Dropbox</h3>
                <p>I have a Dropbox account, but it only really stores a copy of my PhD thesis, my published book and some book ideas. Of the various cloud storage service providers, <a href="https://help.dropbox.com/accounts-billing/settings-sign-in/access-account-of-someone-who-passed-away">Dropbox</a> seems to be the least friendly when it comes to executor access to data. Basically, nothing is set up beforehand, you just have to provide a lot of documentation.</p>
                <h2>Devices</h2>
                <p>We use a number of devices and they all collect files of various types.</p>
                <h3>iMac</h3>
                <p>Most of our files that are not on cloud servers are stored on the iMac. We both have accounts on the iMac, which, of course, is multi-user, so we can switch between one account and the other. I've already mentioned photos in the Photos app, the Users/david/Pictures folder and the Users/david/Documents/PhotoCollections folders. Angela's account, in the Documents folder, is mainly used for her WI related files.</p>
                <p>My Documents folder contains details of our bank account and our investments, although these are backed up on Google Drive.</p>
                <h3>MacBook Air</h3>
                <p>The MacBook Air is really only used to access files stored elsewhere, such as the cloud servers and the files on the iMac.</p>
                <h3>iPad</h3>
                <p>The iPad is not used to store any files. I just contains a number of apps to access information stored elsewhere.</p>
                <h3>iPhone</h3>
                <p>The only files on my iPhone are within the Photos app. Some of these have been uploaded to Google Photos.</p>
                <h3>Old MacBook Air</h3>
                <p>Most files are backed up in the sence that they are either on one of the cloud serives or, if the masteres are on the IMac, then they are backed up on a cloud sevice. However, some files are also backed up on the old MackBook Air.</p>
