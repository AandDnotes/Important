                <h1>Our Finances</h1>
                <p>Details of our finances are spread out across several files, stored in various folders. This document attempts to identify these files and provide pointers to them. The important files are also backed up on Google Drive, in similar folders, and all Google Drive files are backed up in the Data partition on the HP laptop (accessed from the Linux Elementary OS - hold down the esc key during power on to select the boot options).</p>
                <p>If you are logged in to one of our Macs as me, then each of the links below will take you to the file in Finder. If you want to open the file then double click it in the Finder window.</p>

                <h2>Current Account</h2>
                <p>We have a joint account with Barclays <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">and then each have a 1-2-3 account with Santander.</span> (Both closed 24/03/2020)</p>

                        <td>This spreadsheet contains one sheet for each month of the year, together with a sheet that provides an analysis of our income and expenditure. Each month starts out as a copy of the SOs sheet. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Although this spreadsheet is primarily concerned with our Barclays joint account, it does contain a sheet that lists the Direct Debits that are paid from our individual Santander 1-2-3 accounts.</span> (DDs transferred to Barclays 24/03/2020) The Calc sheet helps to reconcile the bank statement against this spreadsheet. Files for previous years can be found in the same folder and the Accounts folder is backup up on Google Drive.

                <h2>Direct Debits</h2>
                <p>The direct debits are <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">split between our three current accounts. Money is paid from our Barclays account each month into both 1-2-3 accounts, from where some direct debit payments are made</span> all paid from our Barclays current account. The list of direct debits can be found in the accounts spreadsheet noted above.</p>

                        <td>This box, kept in the study, contains a plastic wallet for each of the active savings accounts (and probably for some inactive ones as well). The contents of the wallets provide information on the accounts and contain details of online access (if any). However, some online account details are on a sheet of folded A4 paper in the front of one of the slings in the dark green metal box. These accounts do not have any paper records.</td>

Most shares are managed by Equinity (in Angela's name) and dividend notices are downloaded from their site and stored in the <a href="file:////Users/david/Documents/Investments/Shares/EquinityMessages">EquinityMessages</a> folder. There is also a plastic wallet for Equinity in the dark grey plastic filing box (shares were moved from Motley Fool to Equinity). Angela also owns BT, Royal Mail, Marks &amp; Spencer and Reckitt Benkiser shares and David has Standard Life Aberdeen shares.</td>

                <h2>Pensions</h2>
                <p>Money miraculously appears in our Barclays current account from the following sources:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>David's state pension</li>
                    <li>Angela's state pension</li>
                    <li>Angela's teachers pension</li>

                    <li>David's secondary Invensys pension (from his time at Eurotherm)</li>
                    <li>David's Self Invested Pension Plan (SIPP) with Standard Life</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Details of Davids pensions are kept in the filing cabinet under the desk, apart from the PPP, which is in an envelope in a box file on the upper shelf above the desk in the study. Angela's pensions documents are in the dark grey plastic filing box.</p>

                <h2>Grandchildren's Savings</h2>
                <p>Monthly standing orders are in place to put money into Rowan's and Austin's Halifax accounts. However, since Juniper does not have a similar account, her monthly savings are put into an RCI savings account in David's name.</p>

                <h2>J. E. James Finances</h2>
                <p>National Insurance Number: KB028524A</p>
